# Internet Speed Performance Tweeter
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  

- 🧑‍💻 This Python project is part of a web scraping module employing Selenium and will perfom an internet speed check and compare the measured values to promised speeds.  Then the code will Tweet your provider if the connection is underperforming.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
